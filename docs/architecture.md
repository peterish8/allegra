## The three owners of state

| State | Owner | Why there |
|---|---|---|
| Identity (who you are) | **Convex Auth** | It holds the Google secret and signs session tokens. Our API never touches a credential. |
| Listener data (likes, playlists, recents, taste, play tally, shares) | **Convex** | Durable, and the API reaches it through one `UserStore` seam. |
| Cross-device library rows | **Convex** | Revisioned likes, playlist metadata/items, and tombstones use provider-qualified song refs; the phone's SQLite outbox retries offline writes. |
| Active playback session | **Convex Connect** | One authenticated device owns the player lease; other devices send acknowledged commands and can transfer a song, queue, and position. Audio always streams locally. |
| Song relations (which songs go with which, shared by everyone) | **Convex** `songRelations` | Derived, so allowed to be lost, but kept durable because each one costs several provider calls to work out and every listener reuses it. Reached through `RelationStore`. |
| Karaoke output | **Browser memory / device storage** | The worker separates audio locally. A model may be cached locally; no stems or track audio are persisted by the API. |

Everything else — search results, lyrics, artwork, recommendations — is cache, and is allowed to be lost.

## Why the API and the web app ship together

`apps/web` is a Next.js app; `api/index.ts` is an Express app running as a Vercel Function. One
`vercel.json` builds both. The rewrite `/api/(.*) → /api` is ordered **before** Next's optional
catch-all route, which is the only reason Express still receives API requests at all.

That ordering is load-bearing and invisible when wrong: the site renders perfectly while every API
call 404s, so it reads as a frontend bug. `tests/infra/infra-files.test.mjs` asserts the rewrite
exists, and `vercel build` can be run locally to inspect the generated route table.

Express was kept rather than ported to route handlers because `GET /api/stream/:songId` forwards the
client's `Range` header and preserves the upstream status. A `206` must stay a `206`. Rewriting that
path would risk the highest-consequence, least-visible bug in the product (see below).

## Playback

One `<audio>` element lives in the App Router layout, so it survives every route change. Verified:
navigating `/discover → /library` keeps the *same* DOM node and playback continues uninterrupted.

Three invariants, each of which was a real bug:

1. **One funnel.** All play/pause goes through `requestPlayback(playing)`. Never `setIsPlaying(...)`
   *and* `audio.play()` from a component. The raw setter only syncs **from** the element's events.
2. **Load effects must not depend on `isPlaying`.** An effect listing it in deps that calls `.play()`
   re-fires on the user's own pause and instantly resumes — pause appears to do nothing.
3. **Seek pauses. Always resume.** Capture `wasPlaying`, set `currentTime`, resume if it was playing.

### Karaoke

Normal playback uses the original master. Karaoke keeps that element as the transport clock while a
browser worker produces an instrumental stream near the playhead. Seeking and synced lyrics stay on
the same clock. The worker returns both stems (instrumental, and vocals = mix − instrumental), so the
listener's Vocals / Bass & instruments faders mix two sample-aligned buffers; both at 100% is the
original. The mid-side fallback has no stems, so the faders are shown locked with a reason.
Listener preferences (theme, lyrics, karaoke mode and mix, analytics opt-out) live in
`localStorage['allegra-settings-v1']` on the device, never on the server. When the Mel-Band RoFormer model cannot load, cannot keep up, or the song exceeds
the device limit, the client falls back to local mid-side reduction or shows a capability message.

No API route starts a separation job, no track audio is uploaded, and no cloud GPU or per-song state
exists. The model may be cached in browser storage, but the derived audio remains local to the
listener's session.

## Authentication

```
Browser ──► Convex Auth ──► Google ──► session JWT (RS256)
   │
   └──► Express API:  Authorization: Bearer <token>
                        ├─ guest token?   verify with JWT_SECRET (local, free)
                        └─ Convex token?  verify against Convex's published JWKS
```

Both kinds sit behind one `TokenVerifier` port, so routes never branch on which kind of caller they
have. Guest listening works with no Convex deployment at all.

Signing in calls `POST /api/auth/link` once, handing over the old guest token so likes and playlists
made before signing in follow the listener into their account. Merging is a union, so it is safe to
repeat.

## Connect and library sync

`packages/connect` owns the playback-independent session rules. Web and mobile provide a player port
and a Convex transport; the transport listens to owned devices, player state, and command status. A
second device never receives audio bytes. It receives a `SongSnapshot` and playback commands, then
uses its own catalog, stream URL, or downloaded file. Transfer loads the current live position and
queue on the destination before it takes the active-player lease. The web adapter keeps the one
layout-owned `<audio>` element and sends play/pause through `requestPlayback`.

The queue belongs to the session, not to a device: any controller can add a song (next, or at the
end), remove one, move one, or clear what is coming up, and the device that plays applies the
edit to its own queue and reports the result. Both players hand their queue over through the same
`queueStager` in `packages/connect`, so a song the device has not met is looked up while the songs
it already holds move at once.

Convex Presence owns online status. A heartbeat runs only while the app is visible or playing, and
the five-minute internal sweep removes expired commands and checks long-stale device registrations.
A device that leaves (sign-out, a closed tab, a backgrounded idle app) says so, and is offline at
once; one that dies without saying so is offline when its heartbeats run out, 150 seconds later.
Playback can be taken from an owner that is offline, at the position its song would have reached;
an owner that is online must confirm its pause first (`docs/connect-contract.md`).
The command mutation checks account ownership for both source and target and enforces the shared
rate cap. A recipient acknowledges only after its player adapter applies the command; the sender
subscribes to the final status and rolls back an unacknowledged optimistic control.

Likes and playlist items use `saavn:<id>` or `gaana:<id>` refs plus small song snapshots. The API
change feed keeps tombstones and revisions so offline writes cannot resurrect an item deleted on
another device. The web hydrates Saavn refs by catalog id; it displays Gaana snapshots directly and
only plays them after an exact Saavn title/lead-artist match. Mobile keeps downloads separate from
likes, applies local edits immediately, and retries its SQLite outbox after reconnecting. Quick Picks
read the same account taste and recent-play signals, so listening on one signed-in device informs
recommendations on the others.

## Seams worth knowing

| Port | Implementations |
|---|---|
| `UserStore` | `ConvexUserStore`, `MemoryUserStore` (tests, and local dev without Convex) |
| `TokenVerifier` | `GuestTokenVerifier`, `ConvexTokenVerifier`, `FirstMatchVerifier` |
| `CacheStore` | `MemoryCacheStore` |
| `RelationStore` | `ConvexRelationStore`, `MemoryRelationStore` (tests, and local dev without Convex) |

## Recommendations (Quick Picks)

Modelled on Echo's Quick Picks. Every play grows a per-listener **play tally** (`profile.playStats`,
capped at 200 songs: plays, seconds ever, and seconds halving weekly). A shelf takes up to twenty
seeds — now playing, the last five plays, this week's top five, the all-time top ten, the latest
likes — and reads each seed's **song relation**: YouTube Music's song radio and the catalog's
suggestions, merged and matched to catalog rows (`services/songRelations.ts`). Every seed votes for
its neighbours, so a song many of your plays point to ranks first. Missing relations are worked out a
few per shelf (no background jobs), so the map grows as people listen; each is refreshed after 30
days. Audio never comes from YouTube — see `docs/provider-integration.md` rule 14.

Each has a fake used by tests, which is why the suite runs with no network and no cloud account.

## Rules that are not negotiable

1. **`docs/api-contract.md` is the contract.** Propose → update the doc → announce → adapt both sides.
2. **No provider URLs, tokens or secrets in the frontend.** `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is inlined into public
   JavaScript. Everything provider-side is server-side.
3. **Duration is always seconds.**
4. **`{ success, data, error? }` on every API response.** `error` is user-facing copy, never a raw
   provider error.
5. **Animate `transform` and `opacity` only**, from a token in `src/motion/index.ts`.
6. **`prefers-reduced-motion` collapses to opacity.** It never disables a feature.
7. **TypeScript strict, no `any`.** Provider responses get narrow interfaces covering consumed fields.
8. **Every outbound call** gets an `AbortController` timeout and its own try/catch returning empty —
   that is what keeps the provider cascade alive.
9. **The byte-range rule.** `GET /api/stream/:songId` preserves the upstream status and passes through
   `Content-Range` and `Accept-Ranges`. Collapse a `206` to `200` and audio plays perfectly while
   seeking silently does nothing — the highest-risk failure in the product, because it looks fine.
