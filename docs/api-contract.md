# API CONTRACT — frozen at T+1

> **The single most important document on this project.**
> Frontend builds against a mock of this. Backend builds toward it. Neither is ever blocked on the other.

> **To change it:** propose in the channel → update this file → both sides adapt. **Never a silent shape change.** A renamed field at hour 20 costs a night.

Base URL: same-origin `/api`. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is blank everywhere — in dev Next rewrites `/api` to the Express server, and on Vercel it is the Express function.

## Envelope — every response

```ts
type ApiResponse<T> =
  | { success: true;  data: T }
  | { success: false; data: null; error: string };   // error is USER-FACING copy
```
Never leak provider errors. Map network / timeout / 404 / 429 / 5xx to friendly text server-side.

## Shared types — `packages/shared/types.ts`

```ts
export interface UnifiedSong {
  id: string;
  title: string;          // HTML entities already decoded
  artist: string;         // decoded, comma-joined
  album?: string;
  artwork: string;        // 1000x1000 when available
  streamUrl: string;      // ALWAYS our proxy: /api/stream/:id — never a CDN URL
  duration: number;       // SECONDS
  hasLyrics: boolean;
  language?: string;
  playCount: number;      // 0 for Gaana-sourced
  source: 'Saavn' | 'Gaana';
  /** Other release rows for the same recording (search / suggestions only). Never nested. */
  variants?: UnifiedSong[];
}

export interface LyricLine {
  timestamp: number;      // SECONDS (float). All-zero ⇒ unsynced
  text: string;           // '[INSTRUMENTAL]' for empty stamped lines
  lineOrder: number;      // 0-based, contiguous
}

export interface LyricsPayload {
  source: string;         // 'LRCLIB' | 'LRCLIB-search' | 'interpolated'
  type: 'synced' | 'plain';
  matchScore: number;     // 0-100
  matchReason: string;    // 'Title match • Synced • Exact duration'
  lines: LyricLine[];     // PRE-PARSED. The browser never parses LRC.
}
```

## Endpoints

### `GET /api/health`
`→ { ok: true, version: string }` — Render health check.

### `GET /api/search`
`q` (required) · `limit`=20 · `page`=0
`→ ApiResponse<{ results: UnifiedSong[]; source: 'Saavn'|'Gaana' }>`
Empty results → `success: true` with `results: []`, **not** an error.
Cache 1 h. Budget: <800 ms cold, <200 ms cached.

**Recording collapse (2026-09-21):** the provider lists one row per release, so the
same song can appear ~20 times with different compilation covers. Search groups by
recording identity (title without bracketed trailers + sorted artists), elects one
canonical row per group, and attaches the rest as `variants`. Election order:
1. **Meaningful** `playCount` lead (near-ties within 2% / 2 000 plays count as equal —
   Saavn often stamps the same count on every compilation placement).
2. Prefer album name matching the song title (the official single) over editorial
   playlist placements.
3. Prefer a real primary artist over "Various Artists".
4. Prefer albums that are not shared across many different artists in the same
   result set.
Over-fetches from the provider so `limit` is filled after collapse when possible.
The UI may expose `variants` behind a small "N other versions" control — they are
never listed as separate top-level search hits.

### `GET /api/songs/:id` → `ApiResponse<UnifiedSong>` · cache 6 h
### `GET /api/songs?ids=a,b,c` → `ApiResponse<UnifiedSong[]>` · batch hydrate
### `GET /api/songs/:id/suggestions?limit=15` → `ApiResponse<UnifiedSong[]>` · cache 24 h
Same recording collapse as search — suggestions never return twenty copies of one song.
Bare IDs remain Saavn-compatible. Provider-qualified IDs (`gaana:<id>`; also `saavn:<id>`) select a
provider explicitly. Gaana search results and hydrated songs use a provider-qualified stream URL so
the server resolves audio from the same catalog that returned the song.

### `GET /api/home`
`→ ApiResponse<{ trending: UnifiedSong[]; madeForYou: UnifiedSong[]; recommended: UnifiedSong[] }>`
Cache 1 h. Fallback = hardcoded curated playlist IDs.

### `GET /api/artists/:name` → `ApiResponse<ArtistProfile>` · cache 6 h — added 2026-09-21
Additive endpoint (no existing shape changed). `name` is the lead artist as shown on a song. Resolves the name through the provider's artist search (exact match preferred), then returns `ArtistProfile` from `packages/shared/types.ts`: a real `image` (500×500 photo or `null`), `isVerified`, `followerCount`, optional `bio`, `songs` (most popular first, all playable), `albums` (with cover + year) and `similar` artists. `404` when no artist matches.
### `GET /api/artists/faces?names=a,b,c` → `ApiResponse<ArtistSummary[]>` · cache 24 h — added 2026-09-21
Up to 12 comma-separated names; returns `{ id, name, image }` for each one that has a photo. Unmatched names are simply omitted. Used for avatars on lists.

### `GET /api/artwork`
`title`, `artist`, `limit`=5 → `ApiResponse<{ urls: string[] }>` · cache 30 d
Index 0 is the best guess; the array exists for a future "fix artwork" picker.

### `GET /api/canvas` — additive
`title` (req), `artist` (req), `album`?, `duration`? (seconds)
`→ ApiResponse<MotionArtwork | null>` · cache 24 h on hit, 6 h on miss

Finds Apple Music album motion artwork **server-side** and returns its URL only when a
matched release has one. Providers, in order: the official Apple Music catalog (only when
`APPLE_MUSIC_DEVELOPER_TOKEN` is set), `artwork.boidu.dev`, `artwork.m8tec.top` (needs
`album`). `videoUrl` is always an `https://*.apple.com` URL — a direct MP4 when available,
otherwise an HLS `.m3u8` that the client shows only where the browser plays HLS natively.
It is mobile-player-only UI, never blocks ordinary cover art, and returns `null` (with a
successful envelope) when no release qualifies or every provider is down. Provider URLs and
tokens stay server-side. `MotionArtwork` is `{ source: 'Apple Music', videoUrl: string }`.

### `GET /api/lyrics` ⭐
`songId`?, `title` (req), `artist` (req), `duration`?, `syncedOnly`=false
`→ ApiResponse<LyricsPayload>`
No lyrics anywhere → `404 { success: false, error: "No lyrics found for this song." }`
Cache 30 d on hit, **24 h on miss**.

Sources: LRCLIB first, then Better Lyrics, LyricsPlus, Unison, Lyrica and KuGou asked together (each
optional, synced preferred, in that order on a tie). **Answers within ~11 s**: a lookup still running
then answers `404` and keeps going in the background, caching its result, so the client's retry gets
it. The client treats `404` as "no lyrics" (an empty state), never as a connection error.

### `GET /api/lyrics/alternatives` — additive
`title` (req), `artist` (req), `duration`?, `syncedOnly`=false
`→ ApiResponse<LyricsPayload[]>`

Runs only when the listener opens **Other lyrics**. Returns up to six usable, de-duplicated renderings (synced first) from every configured source: LRCLIB, Better Lyrics, LyricsPlus, Unison (up to five of its ranked entries), Lyrica and KuGou (up to three candidates); every item is a complete `LyricsPayload`, so selecting it requires no follow-up provider request. Two entries with the same opening words and type count as one. When a source says which recording it filed an item under, its `matchReason` starts with it (`Artist — Title • …`) so the picker can tell them apart. Sources get the same ~11 s budget; a list missing a slow source is returned but not cached. The normal `/api/lyrics` cascade stays the fast default. An empty array is a successful response: no alternative match was found. Cache 24 h on hit, 6 h on miss.

### `GET /api/stream/:songId` ⭐⭐ — not JSON
Returns **audio bytes**.

| Request | Response |
|---|---|
| no `Range` | `200` + `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, `Accept-Ranges: bytes` |
| `Range: bytes=N-M` | **`206`** + `Content-Range: bytes N-M/TOTAL` + `Accept-Ranges: bytes` |

Also sets `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin` (needed for Web Audio).
**A `206` must never be collapsed to `200` — seeking dies silently.**
Frontend usage: `<audio src={`${API}/api/stream/${song.id}`} crossOrigin="anonymous" />`

### `POST /api/auth/anon`
`→ ApiResponse<{ token: string; userId: string }>`
Called once on first load, token stored client-side and sent as `Authorization: Bearer`. Listening never needs an account.

### Library — all require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
```
GET    /api/libraries                  → ApiResponse<Library[]>
POST   /api/libraries                  { name, description?, isPublic? }
PATCH  /api/libraries/:id              { name?, description?, isPublic?, coverKey? }
DELETE /api/libraries/:id
POST   /api/libraries/:id/songs        { songId }
DELETE /api/libraries/:id/songs/:songId

GET    /api/me/liked                   → ApiResponse<UnifiedSong[]>
POST   /api/me/liked                   { songId }
DELETE /api/me/liked/:songId
GET    /api/me/recently-played     → newest first, at most 25 (older listens are dropped on write)
POST   /api/me/recently-played         { songId, playDuration, playedAt? }
                                      or { songRef, song?, playDuration, playedAt? }
GET/PATCH /api/me/settings
```

`Library` is additive: optional `coverKey` (a Convex storage id) and derived `coverUrl`. `coverUrl` is
never persisted; the API resolves it from Convex on read. `PATCH` accepts the `coverKey` returned by
the authenticated cover-upload flow or `coverKey: null` to clear it.

### `POST /api/ai/mood` ★ stretch
`{ prompt: string }` → `ApiResponse<{ queue: UnifiedSong[]; explanation: string }>`
**Not shipped.** The mood pills in the UI run a plain `/api/search` instead.

### `POST /api/lyrics/translate`
`{ title, artist, lines: LyricLine[], targetLanguage? = "English", language? }` (no auth required)
`→ ApiResponse<{ lines: LyricLine[]; provider: string }>`
Same `lines` length/order/timestamps as the request; `[INSTRUMENTAL]` markers pass through unchanged.
MyMemory is the free keyless primary. A configured, self-hosted LibreTranslate instance is the
fallback; unmanaged public mirrors are never assumed. The legacy `/api/ai/translate-lyrics` path is
an alias for compatibility. `502` means both available providers failed.

### `GET /api/recommendations`
`songId`? (current song, added to taste context if present) · requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
`→ ApiResponse<{ songs: UnifiedSong[]; provider: string; reasoning: string }>`
Ranks the catalog's suggestions with the listener's liked/recent songs, artists, and languages. When
the server has the YouTube Music signal enabled, each seed's song radio is blended in too, after being
matched back to catalog rows (shape unchanged). Seeds also include the listener's most-played songs
this week and of all time, from the play tally that `POST /api/me/recently-played` (a play) and
`POST /api/me/taste/signal` (seconds listened) now maintain — no request or response shape changed. Every result is a real playable catalog row, never an
invented model result. Excludes already-liked or
recently played recordings. `404` means there is no listening context yet. The legacy
`/api/ai/recommendations` path is an alias for compatibility.

## Library sync — additive, 2026-09-30

Likes and playlists are the same on Allegra web and LuvLyrics (`apps/mobile`). No existing shape changed:
the library routes above behave as before, but every one of them (and sharing, MCP, the guest merge) now
writes through library **operations** (`packages/shared/library.ts`), stored per item in Convex
(`convex/library.ts`). The rules:

- Per item, the **newest change wins**, by when the listener made it. A late, older change never
  overwrites a newer one; a time from the future is clamped to now.
- Deletes are remembered, so a stale add cannot bring an item back.
- `likedSongIds` and `libraries[].songIds` stay Allegra (Saavn) ids in their order. A song only a phone
  can name (a Gaana ref) syncs between devices but does not appear in those arrays.

| Endpoint | Auth | Body → response |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/me/library/ops` | Bearer | `{ ops: LibraryOp[] }` (1–100) → `{ rev, rejected: { index, reason }[] }`. A malformed batch is refused whole (`400`). `reason` is `no_playlist`, `missing_name` or `bad_time`. An op older than the current state is not a rejection; it simply loses. |
| `GET /api/me/library/changes?since=<rev>&limit=<n>` | Bearer | → `{ rev, changes: LibraryChange[], more }`. `limit` ≤ 500, default 200. Pass `rev` back as `since` and repeat while `more`. `since=0` returns the whole library, including everything made before sync existed. |

```
SongRef       'saavn:<id>' | 'gaana:<id>'
SongSnapshot  { ref, title, artist, album?, artwork (https URL or ''), duration (seconds) }
LibraryOp     { op: 'like', ref, song?, at }  |  { op: 'unlike', ref, at }
            | { op: 'playlist_upsert', playlistId, name?, description? (null clears), isPublic?, at }  (name needed to create)
            | { op: 'playlist_delete', playlistId, at }
            | { op: 'playlist_add', playlistId, ref, song?, at }  |  { op: 'playlist_remove', playlistId, ref, at }
              at: ms since epoch when the listener did it.  playlistId: [A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,100}
LibraryChange { kind: 'like', rev, ref, song?, liked, likedAt }
            | { kind: 'playlist', rev, playlistId, name, description?, isPublic, coverUrl?, deleted, createdAt }
            | { kind: 'playlist_item', rev, playlistId, ref, song?, deleted, addedAt }
```

Covers are never set through `ops`: only the website's checked upload flow sets one. A signed-in client
can subscribe to the Convex query `library:myRev` to learn that its library changed elsewhere, then refetch.

## Accounts, taste and sharing — additive, shipped 2026-09-21

Additive only: no existing shape changed. Every response uses `{ success, data, error? }`.

### Accounts — **changed 2026-09-22: Google via Convex Auth replaces email/password**

Two kinds of bearer token reach this API, and every route accepts either:

1. **Guest** — minted by `POST /api/auth/anon`, signed by the API (`JWT_SECRET`).
2. **Account** — minted by **Convex Auth** after Google sign-in. The browser gets it from Convex
   directly; the API verifies it against the deployment's published keys
   (`CONVEX_SITE_URL/.well-known/jwks.json`). **The API never sees a Google secret or a password.**

Convex Auth's subject is `<userId>|<sessionId>`; the profile is keyed on the `userId` half, so a
second device or a re-login is the same listener. The first time an account appears, the API creates
its profile and copies the name and email from Convex.

| Endpoint | Auth | Body → response |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/auth/link` | account `Bearer` | `{ guestToken }` → the account profile. Folds that guest's likes, playlists, recents and taste **into the account**. Idempotent (merging is a union). `400` without a guest token, `401` if the bearer is not a verified caller. |
| `GET /api/auth/me` | Bearer | → `{ userId, isGuest, createdAt, displayName?, email? }` |
| `PATCH /api/me/profile` | Bearer | `{ displayName }` → same profile. Empty string clears it. |

**Removed** (no longer routed; they answer `404`): `POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/auth/login`.
No stored password hashes remain — `passwordHash` is gone from the user record.

Sign-out is client-side: Convex clears its session, then the browser calls `POST /api/auth/anon` for a
fresh guest session.

### Taste (what the app learns about a listener)

| Endpoint | Auth | Body → response |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/me/taste` | Bearer | → `{ topArtists: {name,score}[] (<=12), languages: {name,score}[] (<=5), signals: number, onboarded: boolean }` |
| `POST /api/me/taste/seed` | Bearer | `{ artists: string[] (<=30), languages: string[] (<=8) }` → same as `GET`. Onboarding: strong weight, sets `onboarded: true`. |
| `POST /api/me/taste/signal` | Bearer | `{ songId, seconds }` or `{ songRef, song?, seconds }` → `204`. How long a song was really listened to: `<10 s` counts against the artist, most of a song counts for them. |

Taste is also updated **automatically** by existing routes. Legacy songId writes resolve through the catalog; provider-aware writes include a validated `SongSnapshot`, so Gaana plays train the same account taste without a colliding bare ID. Recent rows retain the ref and snapshot for account history and recommendation seeds. A play adds +0.3 when `playDuration` is 0, else by listened time; a like adds +3; an unlike subtracts 2; a playlist add adds +2. Scores decay ×0.985 on every signal, so recent listening outweighs old. Artist credits: headline artist full weight, featured artists half. Recommendations consume this account taste context directly.

### Sharing a playlist

| Endpoint | Auth | Body → response |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/libraries/:id/share` | Bearer (owner) | → `{ code, path: "#shared/<code>" }` (`201` first time, `200` after). Sets the playlist `isPublic: true`. The link is **live**: it points at the owner's playlist. |
| `DELETE /api/libraries/:id/share` | Bearer (owner) | → `204`. Link stops working immediately; `isPublic: false`. |
| `GET /api/shared/:code` | **none** | → `{ code, name, description?, coverUrl?, ownerName, songs: UnifiedSong[] }`. `404` if the code is unknown, malformed, or sharing was turned off. |
| `POST /api/shared/:code/save` | Bearer | → `201 LibraryRecord`. Copies the playlist into the caller's own library (`isPublic: false`, new id). |

Codes are 8 characters from `abcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyz23456789`.

### Playlist cover uploads — additive, shipped 2026-09-21

| Endpoint | Auth | Body → response |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/uploads/sign` | Bearer (owner) | `{ libraryId }` → `{ uploadUrl, coverKey }`. The browser uploads the image to the short-lived Convex upload URL, then `PATCH`es the library with its `coverKey`. `503` if Convex is not configured. |

## Errors

| HTTP | When | `error` copy |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | Bad params | "Something's missing from that request." |
| 401 | Wrong email/password, or no session | "That email and password did not match." / "Please start a guest session first." |
| 404 | Not found | "We couldn't find that." |
| 409 | Email already registered | "That email already has an account. Try signing in instead." |
| 429 | Rate limited | "Too many requests — give it a moment." |
| 502 | All providers down | "Music service is having a moment. Try again shortly." |
| 504 | Timeout | "That took too long. Check your connection and retry." |

### Rate limits

Per client IP, per minute, in memory on each function instance (no database call per request).
A `429` carries `Retry-After` / `RateLimit` headers and the envelope above.

| Bucket | Routes | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| Song changes | different songs started via `GET /api/stream/:songId` (seeks within a song are free) | 30 |
| Stream | every `/api/stream` request, Range requests included | 300 |
| Plays | `POST /api/me/recently-played` | 30 |
| Writes | non-GET `/api/me/*`, `/api/libraries*`, `/api/shared*` | 60 |
| Lookup | `/api/search`, `/api/lyrics*`, `/api/artists*` | 90 |
| Discovery | `/api/ai/*`, `/api/lyrics/translate`, `/api/recommendations` | 20 |
| Uploads | `/api/uploads/*` | 10 |
| Guests | `POST /api/auth/guest`, `POST /api/auth/anon` (each creates a profile) | 10 |
| Auth / OAuth | `/api/auth/*`, `/api/oauth/*` | 30 |
| MCP | `/api/mcp` | 120 |
| Everything else | | 240 |

## Mock server
P3 stands this up at T+2 from this document. P2 develops against it and **flips one env var** when the real API is live. That's the whole integration.
