/**
 * Library sync: likes and playlists shared by Allegra web and LuvLyrics.
 *
 * Every change is a small operation ("like this", "remove that from a playlist")
 * stamped with the time the listener made it. The rules, applied the same way by
 * Convex, the API's in-memory store and anything that replays them:
 *
 * - Per item, the newest change wins. An older change arriving late (a phone that
 *   was offline) never overwrites a newer one.
 * - A delete is remembered (a row with `liked: false` / `deleted: true`), so a
 *   stale "add" cannot bring the item back.
 * - A time from the future is clamped to now, so a phone with a fast clock cannot
 *   win every conflict forever.
 * - A device says what its own clock read when it sent the batch (`sentAt`); the server
 *   measures how far that clock is from its own and moves the batch's times by the
 *   difference (alignOpTimes), so a slow or fast phone clock does not decide who wins.
 * - Every row a change touches gets the next revision number; a device asks for
 *   "everything after revision N" to catch up.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free: the phone bundles this through Metro (see tests/infra).
