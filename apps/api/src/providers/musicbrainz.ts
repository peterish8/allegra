/**
 * Which record a song actually came from.
 *
 * The streaming provider lists one row per *licence*, so a viral song comes back on
 * twenty playlist "albums" — "Throwback TikTok Songs", "Summer Nights Sounds" — and
 * often not once on the record it was released on. Every row then carries the
 * playlist's cover, which is what the listener sees.
 *
 * MusicBrainz knows the difference: a release group is typed, and an editorial
 * compilation is tagged `Compilation` in its secondary types. Filtering to a plain
 * `Album` or `Single` with no secondary type and taking the earliest leaves the
 * original release. Its cover comes from the Cover Art Archive, keyed on the same release group.
 *
 * Both are free, need no key, and are rate limited to roughly one request a second
 * per IP — so callers must cache, and must only ask about rows that need it.
