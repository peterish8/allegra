# LuvLyrics — Project Reference

## Commit style
- Never add AI attribution lines (no "Co-Authored-By" footers). Commits look like normal human commits.
- Use conventional commits: `fix(scope):`, `feat(scope):`, `refactor(scope):`, etc.
- Keep messages short — one imperative sentence, body only when the why needs explaining.

## Stack
- **React Native + Expo** (managed workflow, `expo run:android` / `expo run:ios`)
- **expo-audio** for playback (`useAudioPlayer`, `useAudioPlayerStatus`)
- **Zustand** for all app state (`src/store/`)
- **React Navigation** (native-stack + bottom-tabs)
- **Reanimated 3** + **Gesture Handler** for animations and gestures
- **FlashList** (`@shopify/flash-list`) — used in `SynchronizedLyrics`; prefer over FlatList for long lists
- **SQLite** via `expo-sqlite` for the local song library
- **TypeScript** strict — run `npm run typecheck` before pushing

## Key architecture

### Player
- `PlayerContext.tsx` — wraps `useAudioPlayer`, syncs status to Zustand, handles auto-next
- `playerStatusGuard.ts` — returns `true` to preserve playing state during buffering/seek to prevent UI flicker
- `usePlayerStore` (Zustand) — single source of truth for `isPlaying`, `currentSong`, `currentSongId`, `position`, queue
- `MiniPlayer.tsx` — owns the bottom player (the pill, or the classic bar with its half/full lyric stages), handles seek

### Scrub/seek pattern (must follow everywhere)
```ts
const wasPlaying = usePlayerStore.getState().isPlaying;
await player.seekTo(time);
if (wasPlaying) player.play();
```
`seekTo` is async and pauses playback — always resume if the user was playing.

### Auto-next (end of song)
`PlayerContext` uses `didJustFinish` (cross-platform signal) as primary, plus a `isNearEndFallback` (within 0.35s of end) as secondary. The fallback only triggers when `store.isPlaying` is true — prevents auto-advancing when user manually pauses near end.

### Audio load guard (NowPlayingScreen)
Effect uses `activeLoadSongIdRef` to prevent duplicate `player.replace()` calls and a `cancelled` flag to abort if deps change or component unmounts mid-load.

### Library auto-next
`nextInPlaylist()` in `playerStore.ts` dynamically `require`s `songsStore` (circular dep workaround) to rebuild queue when `currentPlaylistId === 'library'` and queue is null.

## File map

| Area | Files |
|------|-------|
| Playback engine | `src/contexts/PlayerContext.tsx`, `src/contexts/playerStatusGuard.ts` |
| Player state | `src/store/playerStore.ts` |
| Main UI | `src/components/MiniPlayer.tsx`, `src/screens/NowPlayingScreen.tsx` |
| Lyrics | `src/components/SynchronizedLyrics.tsx`, `src/components/LyricsLine.tsx` |
| Scrubber | `src/components/TimelineScrubber.tsx` |
| Downloads | `src/services/DownloadManager.ts`, `src/components/BackgroundDownloader.tsx` |
| Stores | `src/store/` — songsStore, playlistStore, settingsStore, downloadQueueStore, etc. |
| Screens | `src/screens/` — Library, NowPlaying, Playlist, Search, Settings, etc. |

## Rules
- No `console.log` in production paths — wrap with `if (__DEV__)` or use `diag`
- No `as any` unless unavoidable (FlashList type shim is the one exception)
- No mock DB in tests — always hit real SQLite
- Don't introduce shadow styles on NowPlayingScreen — intentionally removed for clean look
- `MAX_CONCURRENT` downloads is 2 — don't raise it without testing on low-end Android

## Branch naming
- `fix/<issue-number>-short-description`
- `feat/short-description`

## CI
```
npm run ci
# runs: check-secrets → lint → typecheck → jest --coverage
```
