/**
 * The Stream home feed, modelled on Echo Music's HomeViewModel:
 *
 *   Quick picks        — radio from your most-played seeds, mixed and shuffled
 *   Keep listening     — what you streamed recently
 *   Daily discover     — one recommendation per seed, "because you played X"
 *   Similar to <artist>— more from the artists you return to
 *   Forgotten favorites— downloaded songs you loved but haven't played lately
 *
 * Radio comes from `recommend` — YouTube Music's automix (as in Echo) resolved
 * to catalog audio, with Saavn radio as fallback (see recommend.ts). Sources
 * are injected so this stays pure/testable.
