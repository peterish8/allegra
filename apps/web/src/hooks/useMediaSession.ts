/**
 * Publishes what is playing to the operating system: lock screen, the Windows volume flyout,
 * macOS Now Playing, Bluetooth and headset buttons, car head units, and the media keys on a
 * keyboard.
 *
 * Every control the OS offers routes back through the same handlers the in-app buttons use, so
 * playback invariant 1 still holds — the OS is just another caller of the one funnel, never a
 * second path that sets state and touches the element itself.
 *
 * The whole API is optional in the platform sense: Safari on iOS supports part of it, older
 * browsers none of it, and a page served over plain HTTP may refuse it. Every call is guarded and
 * a failure is silent, because none of this is required for the app to play music.
